INT. van - dusk

There are 4 people in a van, 3 wearing masks similar to those worn by Hollywood Undead. The Driver, KATIE, 25 is not wearing a mask. The 3 people wearing masks are STACY, TOM and JOSH, 28,29 and 26 respectively. The 3 of them all served in the Army together. Stacy is the leader of the group, she's level headed and calculated. Tom is an African-American man he uses comedy as his defense mechanism, he's not as comfortable with violence or murder as others on the team are. Lastly is Josh who is a quiet, dark person he doesn't talk much but when he does he does it for a purpose.

Stacy
How long ‘till we’re there?

Katie
About 3 Minutes.

Tom
3 Minutes? Jesus

Tom starts fidgeting with the window lever.

STACY
Could ya stop that?

TOM
Sorry. I’m just nervous.

STACY
We’ve done things way more dangerous than this w-

TOM
And I was nervous before those things too.

Tom continues to fidget in his seat, drumming with his fingers and squirming around.

TOM (CONT’D)

Could we put on some music or something?

KaTIE
Sure, anything specific?

TOM
I don’t care. Just turn on the radio.

Katie turns on the radio and the chorus of California Girls by Katy Perry starts blaring.

Josh
(Heavily Grumbles)

TOM
Sorry, Sorry.

Tom reaches forward and shuts off the radio.

There’s silence for several seconds.

TOM (CONT’D)

Someone please say something!

StaCY
Jesus! What is with you?

TOM
Don’t pretend that this is new to you. I’ve always been like this.

STACY
You’ve been like this going into a Godamn war. This is nothing!

TOM
I don’t discriminate. All danger is danger to me.

STACY
How many times have we gone into a situation like this together 20-30?

TOM
So?
STACY
Shouldn’t it be like public speaking? Doing it over and over again makes you not nervous.

TOM
That is such bullshit. I could speak publicly A Thousand times and still be nervous the One thousand and first time.

KATIE
30 seconds.

TOM
That was the fastest 3 minutes of my entire life.

KATIE
I said “about” 3.

EXT. A main street 

The van pulls over at the side of the street

KaTIE
Time to go guys. I’ll be ready for you inside the parking lot. Good luck.

Stacy, Tom and Josh get out of the van in full bodied suits, leather gloves, masks with guns hidden.

The 3 of them make their way to the front door of a casino. The security guards are instantly startled, but are knocked out immediately. They enter into a lavish casino, with 2 floors. It has a beautiful interior. There are a lot of guests in the casino, it isn’t packed though. Josh fires his gun upward shocking all the guests and sending them into a panic. Tom gets up on a poker table and addresses the occupants.  

TOM
Ladies and gentleman, please stay calm or as calm as you possibly can. We don’t want to hurt anyone here, we just want to hurt the casino. (Chuckles) Basically just get down on the ground and don’t get in the way.

While he is speaking the security team is hustling from the 2nd floor. Josh fires at the security guards, intentionally missing them. The crowd is startled more and Stacy quiets them down.

Stacy keeps the crowd at bay while Josh is dealing with the security.

Tom makes his way over to the chip exchange station. There are 3 girls behind the counter. Tom begins to speak to one of the 3 girls, Jill, 27. All 3 girls are very shaken.

Tom holds onto his gun but keeps it down on the counter.

TOM (CONT’D)

How ya doin’ sweetheart?

JiLL
(Shaky) I’m fine.

TOM
What’s your name darling?

Jill
Jill
TOM
OK Jill. Just take this bag here and just fill it up with as much money as you can. Can you do that?

The other 2 girls start walking over to help Jill.

Tom points his gun at them. They stop and are incredibly startled.

TOM (CONT’D)

No, no, no. 3’s a crowd, everyone knows that. You girls get out here with the rest of the people.

The girls are petrified. They walk into the main area where all the guests are and get on the ground.

While Josh is walking around the floor someone starts to talk. Josh walks over closer to him. The man gets gutsy and stands up and confronts Josh.

Man
You guys are fucking morons! You think cause you’ve seen bank robberies in movies and TV you can do it! (Chuckles) You fucktards are gonna pay for this.

Josh points his gun at him.

JOSH
Get down.

MAN
You’ll have to do more than that to scare me. I’ve dealt with my share of punks like you.

Josh switches the safety off his gun.

JOSH
Down, now!

MAN
You think I’ll listen to you? Ha! Over my dead body.

JOSH
I was counting on that.

Josh shoots him in the head. Tom and Stacy are both stunned by this, they react slightly but no one notices. 

All the occupants nearby begin freaking out and chaos erupts. Stacy shouts and fires her gun upward, and settles the crowd.

Sirens are heard off in the distance.

STACY
Guys, that’s our que to go.

TOM
OK.
Tom turns to Jill.

TOM (CONT’D)

Gimme the bag.

She gives him the bag. He grabs it suddenly. The three of them run up the stairs and out to the parking lot.

EXT. Street level 

There are 15 cop cars sitting outside the front door of the parking lot. They’re all franticly scrambling around.

All of a sudden 2 motorcycles zoom out of the parking lot and head towards the highway. Several cops quickly run to their cars and begin to chase after them.

They chase them through the streets until eventually the motorcycles make it to the highway. The highway is elevated very high, there's a large body of water to the right of the highway. To the left and underneath the highway there is land.

Josh and Tom are the ones who are riding the motorcycles. Josh is on the far right of the highway and Tom is on the far left. Tom has the duffle bag wrapped around his torso and it’s held by a strap. They talk to each other through ear pieces. All the meanwhile the cops are chasing after them.

TOM
What the fuck was that about?!?!

JOSH
Not the time. I see the boat, we have about 1 more mile.

TOM
(Sarcastic) That’s great. And now is a great time to talk about it.

JOSH
...
TOM
Are you ignoring me?

JOSH
Not the time.

TOM
Enough with this tough guy BS why’d you do that in there?

JOSH
He deserved it.

TOM
So you’re playing God now?

JOSH
Don’t do you’re guilty bullshit thing.

TOM
It’s not guilty bullshit. They’re called morals.

JOSH
Morals are subjective.

TOM
I think most would agree that murder is bad.

JOSH
This falls into a gray area.

TOM
Bullshit.
JOSH
I think it’s almost time.

TOM
Yup, there it is. We’ll get back to this later, I’m not letting this go that easily.

JOSH
Oh goody.

Tom takes the duffle bag that’s around his chest and throws it back towards the cops.

JOSH (CONT’D)

3...2...1...GO!
The 2 men each jump off their motorcycles and over the edges of the highway. Tom over the left edge and Josh over the left. As Tom is falling to the ground he pulls out a grappling gun used by S.W.A.T members. He shoots it upwards and it grabs onto the edge of the highway. When the cable is fully extended he’s much closer to the ground and most of the weight is shifted onto the wire from the gun. He let’s go, falls to the ground and runs away. Josh jumps into the water and as he’s falling he hits a detonator switch.

The 2 motorcycles on the highway were both thrust towards the center of the highway when the 2 men jumped. They both blow up when Josh presses the button. The cops who were in pursuit slam on their brakes and rush out of their cars. Some men run towards the right edge and some to the left edge. The cops pull out flashlights and search from on the highway, but Josh and Tom are nowhere to be found.

												CUT TO:

InT. police station -  late eVENING

There are 2 men in a detectives office. Detective Carlson, a white man in his forties. And Chief Marcs, a man in his early sixties.

Detective Carlson

...And that’s where we lost them.

CHief Marcs

That’s it? You lost ‘em just like that?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Unfortunately. They had to have planned that jump.

CHIEF MARCS

What makes you say that?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

No one spontaneously jumps off a highway and survives. That was their escape from the beginning. No way we could follow them, and it gives them a head start.

CHIEF MARCS

You have any leads on who these guys are?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

We’re interviewing everyone who was there but we got nothing so far. These guys wore masks, and no plates on the bikes.

CHIEF MARCS

Who are all those people? (Gestures to the main room)

There’s several people there, the casino staff as well as customers from the casino. And a couple dressed in very casual clothing.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

(Points at the couple) Those 2 were on a rented boat celebrating an anniversary or something at the time of the explosion.

CHIEF MARCS

How did that bomb go off? Was it on a timer or was it detonated? 

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Nearby detonator. I think the intension was to be a piss off not to actually hurt anyone. 

CHIEF MARCS

Did those 2 see the guy jump into the river?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

I’d be a much better mood if they had. But no, they looked when they saw the explosion but they didn’t see anything else.

CHIEF MARCS

You said they threw a bag back to you? What was in that?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Mostly singles, they must’ve gotten the money out some other way. Maybe in their van.

CHIEF MARCS

Or the girl who worked there.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Definitely a possibility, I’m questioning her next.

There’s a silence for several seconds, both men are in thought.

CHIEF MARCS

You said you chased 2 motorcycles?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Yeah, why?

CHIEF MARCS

I thought you said that all witness accounts say 3 people robbed the casino?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Yeah, we’re reviewing the security footage again but it looks like 1 of the 3 left in a catering van for a company called SB Catering. We looked into the company, and it doesn’t exist. We tracked the van down as far as we could. We’re trying to pin-point where it is exactly as we speak.

CHIEF MARCS

How’d the van get away from the scene?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

2 of our men let them go, they seemed to have nothing to do with the incident and they claimed they were late for another job. We were told there were 2 female passengers in the car. But we don’t have any leads as to who they may be. (Sigh)

CHIEF MARCS

What’s the matter?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

We have so many people who saw everything that happened, yet somehow we have absolutely nothing.

Carlson gets up and starts walking towards the door.

CHIEF MARCS

Where are you going?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

I’m gonna go let the couple go, and talk to the chick who gave the guy the money.

CHIEF MARCS

Why didn’t you talk to her yet?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

The guys at the scene took forever getting her here.

CHIEF MARCS

Alright, good luck.

Carlson goes over to the couple, they chat a little but the dialogue is inaudible. The couple walks out. Detective Carlson motions for Jill to go into the interrogation room and she follows him in.

Detective Carlson sits down across from Jill. She still seems shaken.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Hi my name is Detective Carlson, but you can call me Mike. You’re name is Jill right? Can I call you Jill?

JiLL
Of course.

DeTECTIVE CARLSON

OK Jill, I just need you to tell me what happened. We’ll do whatever we can to help.

JILL
OK... The 3 of them stormed in and started firing their guns. They were shouting that everyone should cooperate and they didn’t want to hurt us a-

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Did they hurt anyone?

JILL
They shot One guy it was... it was horrible.

She is on the verge of crying.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

It’s OK, It’s OK. We don’t need to talk about that part, just tell me what happened when he took the money.

JiLL
One of the guys came over to me and told me to fill up a bag with money. Then my friends came over to help and he pointed a gun at them.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Did you notice anything about him? Ethnicity? Anything? Are you sure it was a man?

JILL
I could tell from his voice that it was a man. I couldn’t see any skin, on any of them. They were covered head to toe. I couldn’t even tell you their hair color.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

What type of bills did you put in the bag?

JILL
What do you mean?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

The bag we found had all singles, what did you give them?

JILL
I put in 100’s I wasn’t going to try anything cute. He had a loaded gun practically pointed at my head.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

So why do you think we found only single’s? 

JILL
You think I stole the money?

DETECTIVE CARLSON 

I didn’t say that, I just asked a question?

JILL
(Starts crying) I can’t believe you’re accusing me of this insane thing after I was nearly killed!

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Please calm down. I’m just covering all options. I’m not saying I think you did it but we have to rule out the possibility. I’m sorry if that makes you uncomfortable but we have to be thorough. 

JILL
They probably just replaced all the 100’s with singles just to throw you guys off.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

So you’re saying without a doubt that you gave them all 100’s

JILL
Yes. I did. 

DETECTIVE CARLSON

OK thank you for that. Is there anything noteworthy that happened that you could tell me about.

JILL
Ummm... Oh, this is a very minor thing but when one of the people killed a guy in the crowd, the other 2 guys got a little startled. Kind of like they were shocked or something like that.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

You think they were scared?

JILL
I don’t know if scared is the right word but they seemed taken aback, like they weren’t planning on hurting anyone or like this was their first time doing something like this.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

So you think they were new to the whole “criminal” thing?

JILL
I don’t know what it means I just thought it was kinda weird. But don’t get to excited because I could be wrong, I was in a panic myself. So I could be wrong.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Understood. Thanks for coming in we appreciate you’re time.

Detective Carlson gets up to open the door

JILL
I’m free to go?

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Yes ma’am. If we need anything else we’ll call you.

Jill stands up and walks out of the room

JILL
Good night.

DETECTIVE CARLSON

Night.

Texts appears on the screen-                               the escapes : The 1st escape - Stacy’s escape

InT. The parking garage

The 3 bank robbers run out of the casino and towards the catering van, the logo SB Catering is clearly visible. Katie is sitting in the driver seat playing on her phone when she notices them.

KATIE
How’d it go?

TOM
It didn’t finish going yet. I’ll give you my answer in a couple of hours.

Tom and Josh throw open the back doors of the van and pull out 2 motorcycles from the back of the van. Stacy jumps into the back of the van. She turns to the guys.

STACY
Good luck, be safe.

They nod and drive away. Stacy closes the back door. She takes off her jumpsuit and mask. She is a beautiful girl and underneath the jumpsuit she is wearing the same catering uniform as Katie. She takes her jumpsuit and mask and stuffs it into one of the coolers in the back of the van marked SB Catering. She buries it under some food and climbs into the front seat. She fixes her hair and makes sure she doesn’t look like someone who ran away from a bank robbery.

KATIE
Seriously how’d it go?

STACY
It went... mostly as planned.

KATIE
What went wrong?

STACY
One casualty.

KATIE
Oh shit, you had to kill someone

STACY
No, we didn’t have to, but Josh decided to have a pissing contest with some guy in there and shot him.

KATIE
Jesus! What happened?

STACY
Some guy got in Josh’s face and Josh didn’t like it or some shit so he shot him.

KATIE
That’s awful.

STACY
Yeah, very unnecessary.

KATIE
Anything else happen?

STACY
Aside from that guy being dead!? No everything went exactly how we planned!

KATIE
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to be dismiss that.

STACY
(Sigh) Don’t be sorry. I shouldn’t have snapped like that. Josh is the one who deserves to get shit not you.

KATIE
I don’t know him that well but it doesn’t seem like something he would do for no reason. You sure nothing else happened in there?

STACY
I don’t think anything else happened, not that I saw at least. You’re right though it was very unlike him. I’ll give him a chance to explain when this is over.

KATIE
You think they’ll pull this off?

STACY
It wouldn’t have been very good planning by me if I thought they couldn’t do it. Now would it?

KATIE
Fair enough.

There is silence for a couple of seconds.

KATIE (CONT’D)

You think it’s been long enough.

STACY
Maybe another 30 seconds.

KATIE
I’m not gonna lie I’m pretty nervous about this.

STACY
You’ll be fine. You’ve gotten out of tickets before haven’t you?

KATIE
Well of course but I’ve never gotten out of being an accessory to an armed robbery.

STACY
(Chuckles) That’s a fair point. Don’t worry you’ll be fine.

KATIE
Imagine I screw this up. It’s like Josh and Tom jump off a highway, you rob a casino and I can’t just say my lines to the cops.(Laughs)

STACY
(Laughs) That would be pretty pathetic.. Alright let's go.

They drive slowly out of the parking lot and are immediately stopped by 2 cops who look like the 2 typical cops seen in any movie. 

Cop 1

Who are you?

KATIE
We’re the delivery company who brings the Casino food when they’re short on their own storage.

COP 1

Oh, are you guys OK?

KATIE
Yeah we’re fine, we were hiding in the parking lot the whole time we heard the gunshots and just stayed in our car freaking out the whole time. But we’re fine.

COP 2

Did you see those guys leave?

KATIE
Yeah we heard them driving away but just to make sure we were safe we waited a couple of minutes before we left.

The 2 cops look at each other.

KaTIE (CONT’D)

We have 3 more deliveries we really have to make. Would we be able to go? 

The 2 cops point their flashlights into the back of the van and peer in.

COP 1

Do you mind if we just look in the back of your van?

KATIE
No not at all, go right ahead.

The 2 cops open the back doors of the van. They see the marked coolers and an otherwise empty night.

COP 1

Alright you ladies are good to go. Have a good night ladies.

KATIE
Sorry we can’t be anymore of a help. I hope you catch those guys.

COP 1

So do we, thanks.

Katie and Stacy drive away. They drive for a while until they reach a more rundown neighborhood. They pull over at the side of the street. They get out of their car and go into another car that was parked there, turn on the engine and drive away.

They pull up to an apartment building, park their car, get out, and go into the building.

												FADE TO BLACK.

TextS APPEARS ON THE SCREEN-  the 2nd escape - josh’s escape 

EXT. hIGHWAY - NIGHT

Josh jumps off his motorcycle and into the water. There is a large boat in the water passing very close to Josh. He pulls out the same grappling gun that Tom used. He fires it at the rail of the boat, it latches on and he is pulled through the ocean for a few hundred feet then he lets go. He swims a bit and reaches a small rowboat. There’s a girl in the boat, Harriet, 25, she’s very pretty. Harriet is the girl that was part of the couple in the police station.

Josh climbs into the boat. He takes off his full body suit, gloves and mask. Underneath he is wearing cargo shorts and a Hawaiian-like shirt. There is a a picnic cooler on the boat, it’s filled with ice, soda, and beer cans. He empties the cooler into another bucket, then puts his clothing in the bottom of the cooler, and then refills the cooler with the ice, soda and beer. His old clothing is now out of site.

After about 10 minutes police officers approach their boat.

Cop
What are you two doing here?

Harriet
We’re celebrating our anniversary.

COP
How long have you been here?

HARRIET
About an hour. What was that explosion all about?

COP
Did you see anything?

HARRIET
(Turns to Josh) Did you see anything Honey?

JOSH
No, just the police cars then there was an explosion.

COP
Did you see anyone fall into the water?

HARRIET
 Gosh no.

COP
Do you guys mind coming down to the station to answer a few questions?

HARRIET
Are we in some kind of trouble officer?

COP
No, no, not at all. We just need a wittiness account of what happened. You two may be the only people who saw anything.

JOSH
We’ll be happy to help officer.

EXT. PoLICE STATION - LATER

Josh and Harriet walk out of the police station and go to their car. They drive to the same building that Stacy and Katie went to. They park their car, get out, and go into the apartment building.

												FaDE To bLACK.

TeXTS APPEARS ON THE SCREEN - 3rd escape - Tom’s escape

EXT. hIGHWAY underpass - NIGHT

Tom lands pretty hard on the ground. He takes off his jump suit and leaves it on the floor. He runs forward. The police show up to a congregated area where a lot of homeless people live. They think that their perp is hiding somewhere there. They see several homeless people dressed in rags, drinking beer and liquor from inside paper bags.

They come across a white male, he’s lying on his stomach with his arms and legs sprawled out, he appears to have passed out drinking. He’s holding on to a bottle of vodka in his hand. One officer comes closer and turns him over. He sees that the man is clean shaven.

The officer gets the attention of his partner and directs his attention to the unconscious man.

The officer turns toward a long haired and long bearded African-American man.

Officer 1

You know this guy?

Homeless man

No sir. He just showed up here and lay down flat, poured some booze on himself. Don’t no why, but I don’t ask no questions.

OFFICER 1

You think this is our guy?

Officer 2

Probably our best bet.

OFFICER 1

Wanna wake up this sleeping beauty?

The officers shake the man, he, in a very unconvincing way “wakes up”.

OFFICER 1 (CONT’D)

Sir, we need to ask you a few questions.

MAN
What about?

OFFICER 1

Do you mind coming down with us to the station?

MAN
I didn’t do anything.

OFFICER 2

We’re not accusing you of anything, just wanna ask you some questions.

MAN
Alright. But I’m calling my Lawyer.

The man stands up and the officers lead him to their car. The police car drives away.

After several moments. The African-American homeless takes off his rags and drops them on the floor. He is wearing jeans and a T-shirt. He walks into a barber shop nearby, he gets a haircut and shave. He comes back to the area where he fooled the police. He moves some garbage around and pulls out his pair of gloves and his mask. He goes to his car and puts his gear in the trunk of his car. Then he gets into his car and drives to the same apartment that everyone else did.

InT. stacy’s apartment

Stacy, Josh and Katie are wall sitting around the living room. Harriet walks out and as she’s leaving Tom walks in. Tom is pissed.

TOM
Josh what the fuck was that?!?!

JOSH
Hmm?
TOM
You shot that guy like you were Michael fucking Corleone or something. 

JOSH
...He deserved it.

TOM
Oh I’m sorry, Batman! I didn’t realize we were vigilantes now.

JOSH
...
STACY
Josh don’t be difficult.

JOSH
I had a good reason.

TOM
...You’re insane. That’s it, you are a crazy person, and you’re head is all fucked up.

JOSH
Oh Shut up! I killed that guy cause he was asking for it. He thought he was big shit and opened his mouth, so I made him pay.

TOM
He showed guts so you killed him?

JOSH
Exactly.
TOM
So you think people should just roll over and die and not fight.

JOSH
Is that so wrong.

TOM
We were in the military together! Do I need to remind you about that?!? How can you say you killed him for that when you did it yourself?

JOSH
You’re making my point for me. How many people do we know, who come back from doing the bravest Godamn thing imaginable that get fucked when they get back home? Seriously Tom, think about it, there are countless people that are homeless, suffering from PTSD, and have either killed loved ones or themselves because of how fucked being brave got them. No one here seems to give a fuck about those...those heroes. It’s all bullshit! I hear people all the time who destroy the war in Iraq and their reasoning is “we can’t put our boys in danger.” But when they get home and are actually suffering, no one does shit, they just leave them to die. So you know what? When I see someone being brave I won’t give two fucks either. In fact I’ll punish them for it just like we’re getting punished.

There’s a silence for several seconds.

TOM
That was a great speech, loved the passion. But you’re still a fucking psychopath.

JOSH
(Angrily) You know I am so sick of your jokey bullshit.

Josh gets up and punches Tom in the face. They throw several punches back and forth and are shouting at each other at the same time. Stacy gets between the two and breaks up the fight.

STACY
Guys! Knock it off!

Both Josh and Tom are a bit winded. They’re breathing very heavily.

Josh walks towards the door.

JOSH
I need to talk a walk.

He leaves the room.

TOM
I’m really worried about him.

STACY
Worried? I would think angry, why worried?

TOM
He’s been really cold recently.

STACY
He’s always been quiet you know that.

TOM
It’s not just him being quite. He’s become almost heartless. I mean Stace, he freakin’ shot someone!

STACY
He had a reason.

TOM
Did you here his reason? It made no 
 sense! I get being upset about how soldiers are treated. But based on him equating people giving up on those who were brave, now he has the right to kill anyone who does anything brave? 

STACY
Don’t get mad at me I didn’t say it! Why didn’t you tell him what you just told me?

TOM
Did you not hear me tell him?

STACY
Oh come on Tom. We both know that you were not trying to talk to him you were doing your same old snarky bullshit that you always do. You weren’t trying to have a discussion you were trying to be funny.

TOM
I don’t joke about a guy getting shot. That was not me trying to be funny.

STACY
You know what I mean. You were just trying to shout your opinion at him, not have a discussion.

TOM
Because there is no logical reason to shoot someone in that situation. Do you think he was right?

STACY
No, but I’m just not so bent out of shape about it?

TOM
That’s a man’s life Stace. How don’t you care?

STACY
I’m not saying I don’t care. All I’m saying is if people have guns and are robbing a casino you don’t try to be a smart ass and open up your mouth. He kinda had it coming.

TOM
He had it coming? He’s supposed to expect that a lunatic will shoot him?

STACY
In that situation, yes he should expect it. He was playing with fire, the guy he was talking to had a gun!

TOM
I can’t believe you’re taking his side on this.

STACY
I’m not taking his side I’m just saying why I’m not that mad at him about it. Think about it like this, when you here a celebrity dies from an overdose it’s sad right? But not so sad cause you’re thinking “Well, he new the risk of death was there when he took heroin.” But a guy like Anton 
, R.I.P. You feel awful about it cause he did nothing wrong.


TOM
So you’re saying that since this guy was a smart ass he deserved to get shot?

STACY
I’m not saying he deserved it, I just feel less bad b-

TOM
Badly.
STACY
No, trust me it’s bad.

TOM
Whatever. I need a beer.

He turns and walks towards the fridge.

ExT. pOLICE STATION - NIGHT

Jill walks out of the police station and goes towards her car. She looks at her phone, she has several missed calls and texts from Stacy. She has another missed call from a man named Mr. Yang.

She calls Mr. Yang.

JiLL
I’m out.

Mr. Yang

Does anyone suspect anything?

JILL
Ha, no. I’m the victim here.

MR. YANG

What about your partners?

JILL
Some missed calls and texts but I doubt they think anything of it. They probably think I’m still in custody.

MR. YANG

So you’ll bring the money now?

JILL
Just need to pick my stuff up from work.

												FaDE TO BLACK.

TextS APPEARS ON THE SCREEN - the 4th escape - Jill’s escape

InT. casino - NIGHT

The robbery is in the process of going on. Tom tells other two girls to go to the main area. Jill begins filling the duffle bag with singles. She brings stacks of One-Hundred dollar bills and singles to the area where she’s filling the bag. She fills Tom’s bag with singles and she puts the One-Hundred dollar bills into her own bag.

Tom grabs the duffle bag and the three thieves run out. The girls who were cast to the main area run over to comfort Jill.

Girl 1

Are you OK?

JILL
I’m fine. He didn’t hurt me.

GIRL 2

Oh my god, you must have been terrified.

JILL
Yeah, that was the scariest moment of my life. I just want to go home.

Police officers run into the building.

COP
Is everyone OK?! Did they take any money?

Someone directs the officer to the counter where Jill is.

Cop (CONT’D)

Which one of you girls gave them the money?

JiLL
I did.

GIRL 1

But we were all here when they got here.

COP
Can I ask you ladies to please come down to the station?

JILL
Sure, can I just get my shoes from my car?

COP
Absolutely.
She goes to her car drops off her bag and changes her shoes. She then walks with the police officer to the car. She closes the door and they drive to the station.

												FaDE TO BLACK.

InT. a club - LATER

Harriet is in a night club. Music blaring, and lights flashing. There are a lot of people who are drunk, high or both. They’re all dancing.

Harriet stumbles out of the club drunk. She’s walking down the street stumbling as she walks.

Harriet’s 

A Blurry outline of a person is walking towards her. The figure raises its hand and slits her throat. She falls to the ground and bleeds to death.

Josh walks away from Harriet’s body like nothing happened. He slips the blade back into his pocket and walks into the night.

InT. sTACY'S APARTMENT

Tom and Stacy are in middle of a conversation. While Katie is in the other room.

TOM
Did the cops give you any problems?

STACY
(Chuckles) No, they see two girls, they don’t think we could have anything to do with a “big bad robbery”. You just play into stereotypes. How about you?

TOM
Same thing. I just put on an accent like I was from the ghetto. Two white cops hear a black guy with a ghetto accent they expect you to be homeless.

STACY
Billy didn’t mind going in for it?

TOM
, he does stuff like this all the time.

STACY
How much did you have to give him?

TOM
700.
STACY
And the homeless people who were there?

TOM
100 a piece.

STACY
How many people were there?

TOM
8.
STACY
Not too bad.

TOM
Yeah not too terrible... Do you feel bad about what we did?

STACY
You mean the Robbery?

TOM
Yeah.
STACY
No. We’re giving the money to people who really need it. Why? You feel bad?

TOM
I guess I feel kinda guilty, I don’t know. How much are you giving?

STACY
50%
TOM
Same. Did you decide which charity?

STACY
Does it matter? Anything that gives money to vets is good, and any charity that gives all the money to those in need and doesn’t keep any for themselves.

TOM
I guess.

STACY
...Random but do you know what movie I saw on TV the other night?

TOM
The Dark Knight?

STACY
Nope.
TOM
Shawshank?
STACY
Nope.
TOM
Lord of The Rings?

STACY
Nope.
TOM
I’m getting bored of this game.

Stacy
(Chuckles) Fine. In Bruges

TOM
Oh Shit! I love that movie! Was it censored?

STACY
Hell no. You can’t watch that movie censored.

TOM
Oh no way. “We’re still in Fucking Bruges!” Love that movie.

STACY
(Laughs)
TOM
How did you expect me to guess that?

STACY
I didn’t. I just wanted to see how long you’d go for.

TOM
(Chuckles) You know I never liked watching movies on TV.

STACY
Really? I do it all the time. Why don’t you like it?

TOM
All the commercials drive me crazy. I’m sitting there trying to watch a movie about robots or aliens or some crap. I don’t need a pause for 20 minutes reminding me that I won’t get hard in 30 years. I just wanna watch the damn movie!

STACY
Well that got really graphic.

TOM
I’m sorry it’s just annoying. I did watch a movie on TV recently though, wanna guess which?

STACY
No. (Laughs)

TOM
Fine. It was Transformers 2

STACY
Did you get high and watch it?

TOM
No, it was kinda just on in the background and I tuned in every few minutes. I happened to be watching it with subtitles, did you know there’s an 
 in that movie?

STACY
I barely remember that movie. But I definitely would’ve remembered that. When is there one?

TOM
When uh what’s his face um... Shia Lebouf almost dies and he goes to some kind of heaven thingy with all the transformers. So when all that’s happening Megan Fox runs over to him and yells it.

STACY
I remember that scene but I don’t remember her yelling it.

TOM
Well I needed subtitles to know it was there if that tells you anything about how audible it is.

Katie comes in from the other room. She seems a little startled.

KATIE
Did you guys see what happened?

TOM
No, what?

KATIE
Turn on channel 3.

TOM
Who watches local news?

Stacy picks up the remote and turns on the TV. A middle aged Latino women is reporting on Harriet’s murder.

Reporter
The woman had her throat slit by some sort of knife. The police are saying there are no witnesses at this time. I spoke to the victim’s partner just moments ago.

The TV cuts to an interview the reporter had with Josh several minutes before.

REPORTER (CONT’D)

Sir do you have any idea what happened?

JOSH
No, I spoke to Harriet a couple of hours ago. She told me she was going out with her friends to some club. Next thing I know I’m getting calls that she was killed. It’s just unbelievable.

REPORTER
I’m sorry about your loss.

JOSH
I just wanna catch the son-of-a-bitch that did this.

The news cut back to the reporter in present time talking about the case. Tom, Stacy and Katie all tuned out. They’re all in shock and disgust.

Tom
He is so full of shit!

KATIE
Why?
TOM
He’s only there because he’s playing her boyfriend from the heist. He doesn’t care about her, he’s playing a character.

KATIE
Isn’t that good for our sake?

STACY
It is, but how did he know to be there?

KATIE
You guys are saying you think he did it?

TOM
Probably.
KATIE
What makes you guys so sure?

StACY
You know Josh pretty well, he doesn’t talk a lot. That whole speech had to have been planned. If he really wasn’t sure who did it he would’ve given a short answer and gone after the guy himself. Not been on the verge of tears in an interview. He was playing the part of “concerned boyfriend” there.

KATIE
You think he did it for money?

STACY
Doubt it. He was the biggest advocate of donating the money. So unless he thought Harriet wasn’t gonna donate enough...

KATIE
That doesn’t make sense.

STACY
Whenever he gets here we’ll ask him. All I know is he better have a good reason for this.

TOM
Maybe she was acting too brave.

STACY
Fuck off.

Josh walks into the apartment. Stacy, Tom and Katie all go to the opposite side of the room.

STACY (CONT’D)

What happened?

JOSH
Huh?
STACY
Why’d you kill her Josh?

JOSH
Who?
STACY
(Angrily) You fucking know who.

JOSH
I didn’t trust her.

STACY
Why not?

JOSH
I didn’t know her well.

KATIE
Does that mean you’re gonna kill me?

JOSH
No. Stacy knows you.

STACY
I knew Harriet.

JOSH
That was more of a friend of a friend thing.

TOM
Why did you wake up now and realize you didn’t trust her? Why do the job in the first place if you knew she was involved?

JOSH
...
STACY
... Holy shit. You were planning on killing her from the beginning weren’t you?

Tom
What the fuck happened to you?!

JOSH
It was a necessary precaution. She was a loose end. Did you guys really think we would get away with this robbery with her running around?

KATIE
Does that mean you’re gonna kill me because I’m a “loose end”?

JOSH
No. I already said, Stacy trusts you.

KATIE
How do I know you mean that, and you won’t just kill me anyway?

JOSH
You don’t. But believing it may help you sleep better at night.

TOM
Listen to yourself man! You sound like a psycho. How do I know you won’t hurt ME?!

JOSH
I’ve known you for about 25 years I’d never touch you.

TOM
How do I know that?! I don’t know what’s going on in your fucked up head!

STACY
Josh, last chance, why did you kill her? Give us the real reason this time.

JOSH
There is no other reason. She was a loose end that I needed to tie up that’s all there is. And as far as hurting you guys I would never do it. You two (points at Stacy and Tom) are like my own blood, and you (Katie) are trusted by my family which means I trust you. I didn’t know that other chick so I had to take extreme measures. 

STACY
She was a person! Get out! I don’t know what has gotten into you but you’re clearly going through some shit. Stay away from us for a while. I’ll call you when your share arrives but right now you need to think about how insane you’re acting. I don’t know if we can be around you now.

JOSH
Stace, are you serious?

STACY
Yes Josh you’ve gone fully fucking psychotic. Leave. We’ll regroup in at least a couple of days. You might want to consider getting some professional help.

There’s silence for several seconds. Josh is looking at both Tom and Stacy. Tom seems a bit uncomfortable while Stacy has a stern and confident expression on her face. After several moments Josh walks out. Tom turns to Stacy.

TOM
What just happened?!

STACY
He’s out of control.

TOM
I knew this heist was a bad idea!

STACY
What’s that got to do with it?

TOM
The three of us have been so close for so many years, now this heist happens and Josh goes insane and we’re all fighting!

STACY
You know when everything started going to shit! It’s not because of this! No one changed because of a godamn heist!

There’s a silence for a couple of seconds.

KATIE
I really hate to be insensitive but you guys keep talking about it. Where is the money?

STACY
You’re right. She should be out by now.

TOM
Did you call her?

STACY
Yeah and texted a bunch of times.

TOM
Try again, maybe she got out.

Stacy calls Jill. No answer

STACY
Nothing.
TOM
Straight to voice mail?

STACY
No it rang. Her phones on.

TOM
What’s taking so long?

STACY
Don’t get nervous. They’re probably questioning her a lot. We took a decent chunk of cash.

KATIE
I think I’m gonna head home.

TOM
Why don’t you stay? He could go after you!

KATIE
I don’t know him as well as you two, but I don’t think he’s gonna go on a killing spree.

TOM
He’s already killed two people!

STACY
Tom, relax. Katie, you feel safe going home? Are you sure you don’t want to stay?

KATIE
There’s no room for me here, and I’ll be fine at home.

TOM
At least let one of us take you home.

KATIE
Fine. Stace you wanna take me? (Looks at Tom) no offense.

TOM
None taken. I’d rather not leave the house with Patrick Bateman walking around.

KATIE
(Chuckles) Good night Tom. Try to relax.

InT. mr. yang’s Office - NIGHT

Mr. Yang’s office is a dimly lit room with a big desk. Pretty typical mafia wannabe look. Mr. Yang is a middle aged Asian-American man. He is in the room with several henchman. 

Jill walks into the room.

JiLL
I think they’re starting to get concerned.

MR. YANG

Is it time for me to send my men after them?

JILL
Wait, you weren’t the one who killed the girl?

MR. YANG

No, what girl?

JILL
You didn’t see that a girl was killed in this neighborhood?

MR. YANG

I saw some stories about it online. Who is she?

JILL
She was one of the people involved in the job. I thought that was you. In any event, now would be a good time to go after them.

MR. YANG

How many are left now?

JILL
Now only 4.

MR. YANG

Do you have their locations?

JILL
How many can you get by the end of the tonight?

MR. YANG

At best one, it’s very late.

JILL
OK go for Katie. The other three are almost always together in Stacy’s apartment. I’ll right down Katie’s address for you.

MR. YANG

Is she the one who wasn’t in the military?

JILL
Yup, she’s the one.

MR. YANG

Perfect. Write all their addresses and names.

Jill writes down the information each address with a name across from it. She hands it to Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang says something in Chinese to one of the henchman, he stops.

MR. YANG (CONT’D)

What was her name?

Jill
Katie.
Mr. Yang continues to talk to the henchman he points at the paper and the man takes the paper then leaves.

JILL (CONT’D)

What did you tell him?

MR. YANG

I told him to go after Katie tonight and the rest in whatever order he chooses tomorrow night.

JILL
It’s going to be tough to get rid of the other 3, unless they split up, but even then they’re good.

MR. YANG

My men are very talented, trust me.

JILL
I’m not doubting you, I’m just warning you.

MR. YANG

Do you have the money?

JILL
Ah, almost forgot.

She picks up her bag and puts it on the table. It’s overflowing with one hundred dollar bills.

JILL (CONT’D)

Satisfied?
MR. YANG

Very.
INT. katie’s apartment - LATER

Katie is sitting around her room drinking wine and watching TV. She’s clearly had a decent amount to drink. She stumbles a bit after she goes out of her room and goes to the bathroom.

Mr. Yang’s henchman climbs through her apartment window while she’s in the bathroom.

Katie is talking to herself in the mirror while the water runs in the sink, because she’s pretty drunk. She shuts off the running water. Then she hears a noise from the henchman in the living room. She begins to freak out. She reaches into her robe pocket in search of her phone. She realizes she left it charging in her room. She panics for several seconds, then she decides to take the toilet tank cover for self-defense and go out and confront whoever is there.

She opens the door slowly and proceeds to creep towards the living room.

KATIE
If anyone’s there I’ll fuck you up so you better leave!

She inches into the living room and she turns on the lights as she does it, she sees the henchman.

KATIE (CONT’D)

Who are you?!?

He wastes no time. He shoots her square in the forehead killing her instantly. She falls down and drops the toilet cover, it hits the wall on the way down causing it to remain intact. He walks over to her body and picks up the toilet cover and puts it back. He drags her body into her bedroom and puts her into her bead and covers her entire body with a blanket.

INT. sTACY'S APARTMENT

Stacy is sleeping in her bed, while Tom is passed out on the couch in the living room. Stacy has a dream.

EXT. afghanistan - daY [flashback]

Stacy, Josh, Tom and Ryan, 20, are sitting around a military base camp. Ryan is several years younger then the rest of the people there but he fits in like a younger brother. He’s handsome and charming. They’re all dressed in their military uniforms.

TOM
What do you guys miss most about home?

Ryan
My family.

JOSH
Oh shut up! Give a real answer not one you’re supposed to say.

RYAN
Hey, just because your family hates you doesn’t mean everyone else’s does too.

JOSH
(Fake Crying) I told you that privately, don’t tell people that! They’re not supposed to know.

STACY
(Chuckles) I just miss this bar down the street from me.

TOM
Oh Marty’s?

STACY
Yeah, that place was great. Good place to just relax and have a beer.

Josh
You see Ryan, beer is a type of alcohol that people, that aren’t little children, can drink.

Ryan
Oh HA-HA.

Josh
I just miss being able to walk around and not be surrounded by people that want to kill me.

TOM
I miss movies.

JOSH
Really? You miss movies more than walking around and not living in fear of being shot at?

TOM
I’m black so that fear exists even back home.

JOSH
As a white guy I will not try to argue with you on this one. All I can say is fair enough.

Ryan
That’s a good fight to 
.
STACY
Which movie do you miss most?

TOM
I miss all the Pirates movies.

RyAN
Pirates of the Caribbean?

JOSH
No the Pirates of the Dakota’s. Of course!

RYAN
Jesus sorry!

STACY
Would you two behave mommy and daddy are trying to have a discussion. So anyway, I only liked the first one of those, I hated the rest.

TOM
You’re like everyone else, I don’t get why people hate them! The third is my favorite! They’re so much fun, great action, great comedy, likeable characters interesting plot what’s not to like? I will admit the 4th is not as good as the others but those first 3, I’m convinced came straight down from heaven.

STACY
There is so much going on in that movie that is so confusing and makes no sense.

TOM
First of all it does make sense, secondly if you wanna nitpick certain things you can do that with a lot of movies. Terminator 1 doesn’t make sense, hate to break it to you.

JOSH
I’m sorry did you just hate on Terminator? Oh, Ryan, Terminator is a movie that came out in the 
. Believe it or not they had movies back then.

Ryan
You’re only like 3 years older than me!

JOSH
Shut up.

STACY
Josh you’re acting like a child.

JOSH
Whatever you’re not my real mom!

STACY
(Laughs hard) Back to your terminator thing Tom, the reason people let the plot holes of that movie go is because the rest of the movie is good and not filled with drunk people spewing nonsense.

TOM
I think the rest of Pirates 3 is amazing, there is absolutely no spewing and definitely not that of nonsense!

STACY
Really? What’s the plot of the movie.

TOM
So basically the pirates have to rescue Jack from the dead because the pieces of eight are calling for the meeting of the pirate lords to take place and-

STACY
See nonsense.

TOM
Well you can do that with any movie!

Ryan
No you can’t.

TOM
Yeah you can.

RYAN
Do it to Double Indemnity.

All three of them pause and look at Ryan in shock.

RYAN (CONT’D)

That’s right I know some old movies.

JOSH
You really are the little brother I never had, that movie is one of my favorites ever. I have a new found respect for you.

STACY
Seriously, props for that pull. Well Tom, can you do it to that movie?

TOM
When I said every movie I meant every fantasy type movie. Like say the plot to star wars or Lord of the Rings. If you say the names of characters in those movies you sound like a crazy person.

STACY
I agree and I’m sorry to say it but, those movies are overrated.

TOM &amp; Josh

How dare you!

StACY
Sorry they are.

RyAN
I got your back on this one Stace. Totally overrated.

STACY
This is one of the many reasons that I love you.

JOSH
Now I realize why I hate you.

TOM
They are cinematic icons! Both of them, they paved the way for so many things. I think my heads gonna explode.

STACY
Them paving the way doesn’t make them great as movies on their own. It just makes them very influential, that I won’t argue. They definitely are influential.

TOM
What is wrong with you?!?

STACY
And what did Lord of the Rings influence really? Name one movie that happened because of Lord of the Rings.

TOM
The Hobbit trilogy.

STACY
Exactly.
TOM
They’re beautiful adventures.

STACY
They’re boring and like 8 hours each movie. And the 3rd one never freakin ends.

TOM
I hate all of you.

STACY
Just because we have different opinions about movies doesn’t mean I don’t love you.

TOM
That’s fair. I take it back, I don’t hate you, You’re all just morons who have dumb opinions.

STACY
(Sigh)
RyAN
We’re so dysfunctional. We each had like seven mood swings about each other in one conversation. We’re like an actual family.

Everyone laughs.

JOSH
I’ll take you guys over my actual family.

StACY
You’d take a piece of cake over your family!

TOM
I’d take a piece of cake over you guys, sorry.

JOSH
Same. Cake is better than people, I’m an avid believer in that.

RyAN
What about the people who bake the cake?

JOSH
(Opens his mouth to speak then closes it)

STACY
(Laughs) Wow!

Stacy and Ryan high five.

TOM
Is that the first time you’ve been stumped?

JOSH
No it’s happened before .

TOM
Like when?

JOSH
Well when I-

All of a sudden there is a massive explosion in the base sending everyone flying across the room. The explosion was closest to Ryan causing him to take most of the impact. There are sirens blaring. Stacy gets up and is slightly disoriented, there’s a loud ringing in her ears. She sees Tom and Josh slowly get up as well. All 3 of them have various cuts or injuries to their faces causing them to bleed. The 3 of them run over to Ryan who’s body is ripped apart, and his face is almost unrecognizable. The 3 of them stare at one another in utter shock for several seconds. Another explosion goes off.

Stacy wakes up suddenly. She’s sweating and breathing heavily. She gets up and goes to get a drink from the kitchen. She opens the fridge and takes something out. She wakes Tom up in the process.

TOM
Everything OK?

STACY
Yeah, I’m fine. Just thirsty that’s all.

TOM
Why are you up this late?

STACY
My dream woke me up.

TOM
Ryan again?

STACY
Yeah, the same dream over and over again every night. I just keep re-living that day.

TOM
It’s stayed with all of us.

STACY
It still effects you too?

TOM
Of course. I wouldn’t have done this job if it wasn’t for Ryan.

STACY
Why?
TOM
When you first asked me to do this with you guys, I don’t know if you remember but I said no.

STACY
Yeah I do. Josh and I were gonna do it alone.

TOM
What changed my mind was I thought about Ryan, and imagined if he would’ve survived that blast. He would’ve been sent home back to his family. But he probably have suffered more.

STACY
That day haunts me, his face all fucked up. His limbs all over the room... He was just a kid.

TOM
We all were just kids. It haunts all of us. Look at Josh for Christ’s sake he’s gone nuts.

STACY
At least we didn’t get screwed up as much as that.

TOM
So you really think that he’s changed.

STACY
I’m not sure.

TOM
That day was a nightmare, it really could be the cause.

Stacy
I don’t wanna think about it anymore, I’m going back to bed.

TOM
G’night.
Stacy walks back to her room.

INT. sTACY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Stacy walks out of her bedroom in a robe, having just showered. Tom is already awake.

TOM
Morning.
STACY
What’s up? Did you speak to Katie by any chance?

TOM
No, why?

STACY
I texted her like two hours ago, and I just called three times.

TOM
So? Maybe she’s still sleeping?

STACY
(Looks at her phone) It’s 11:30 she would be up by now.

TOM
I’m sure she’s fine. You sound more nervous than me.

STACY
I’m nervous when it makes sense.

TOM
Well it makes sense to me when I’m nervous.

STACY
It never does though. I’ll just go over there and make sure everything’s OK.

TOM
Aright, sounds good to me.

Stacy grabs some food and walks out of the apartment.

InT. kATIE'S APARTMENT building

Stacy walks into the building just as a resident is leaving. She smiles at the doorman.

Doorman
Morning Stacy.

STACY
Morning. Did you Katie come by?

DOORMAN
No she should be up though, feel free.

STACY
Thanks.
Stacy walks up the stairs to Katie’s apartment and knocks on the door.

STACY (CONT’D)

Katie! It’s Stacy, open up!

No answer. She continues to knock.

STACY (CONT’D)

Come on Katie it’s almost 12 o’clock get up!

Still no answer.

STACY (CONT’D)

I’m coming in!

Stacy pulls out a key and unlocks the door. She walks into Katie’s apartment.

STACY (CONT’D)

Hello!
She walks into Katie’s bedroom. She sees that her sheet is covering her entire body. She rusher over and removes the cover. She sees the bullet wound to the head. Stacy’s initial reaction is shock but it quickly changes to absolute rage. She picks up Katie’s phone, dials 911 and leaves the phone on the night stand. She walks out of the room as the phone rings.

ExT. city street - MOMENTS LATER

Stacy is walking down the street. She calls Tom.

TOM
What’s going on?

STACY
Katie’s dead someone shot her.

TOM
What the fuck?!?! He said he wouldn’t touch her!

STACY
He lied. He’s completely unstable.

TOM
You’re coming back here now?

STACY
No, I’m going to talk to Josh.

TOM
Stacy, he’s gone crazy it’s too dangerous!

STACY
He wouldn’t touch me.

TOM
That’s what he said about Katie!

STACY
If he tries to hurt me I’ll kick his ass.

TOM
That’s a fair point. You know where he is?

STACY
I have a good idea.

TOM
OK, please don’t die on me.

STACY
Don’t worry no one else is gonna die.

TOM
I feel like I’ve heard that before.

STACY
Talk to you later.

TOM
Bye.
InT. gun range - late afternoon

Josh is shooting a pistol at some targets. He hits the target perfectly with every shot. He’s alone in the range. Stacy walks in, while Josh is reloading his gun he sees her. He puts his gun down, takes out his earplugs, takes off his goggles and walks over to her.

STACY
Josh, Tom and I are done given you chances. I defended you last time but I can’t defend it anymore.

JOSH
What are you talking about?

STACY
I found Katie’s body Josh.

JOSH
She’s dead?

STACY
Don’t bullshit me Josh.

JOSH
I honestly had no idea.

STACY
Oh I’m sure you didn’t. Listen, don’t get upset I’ll give you your share of the money and that’s it. We’re done.

As Josh talks he reaches to put his arm on Stacy’s shoulder.

JOSH
Stace, ya gotta listen to me.

She steps back not letting her reach him.

STACY
Don’t touch me. Josh, you need help. You’re out of control. I’m not listening to you anymore.

Josh takes a step forward.

STACY (CONT’D)

Get any closer and I will fuck you up.

Josh slowly pick up his hand and puts it on her shoulder. He looks deeply into her eyes.

JOSH
Stacy please just listen.

Stacy pulls Josh’s arm forward and knees him in the groin. After getting hit she grabs his head and knees him in the face.

Josh falls to the floor. He’s lying there coughing and bleeding. He’s clearly in a lot of pain.

STACY
Stay away from us.

INT. staCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Tom is alone in the apartment eating takeout when Stacy gets back.

TOM
Thank god you made it back. Did you find him?

STACY
Yeah, I knocked some sense into him.

TOM
When did you tell him to come back?

STACY
Never. I told him he’s done.

TOM
Really? What did he say.

STACY
I didn’t give him a chance to talk.

TOM
So what do we do with his share?

STACY
We’ll give it to him. He’ll do the right thing with it.

TOM
How can you be sure?

STACY
I can’t but I keep my word and our deal was split it evenly, so that’s what I’m gonna do.

TOM
Did he say he killed Katie?

STACY
What?
TOM
Katie. Did he admit that he killed her?

STACY
No. He denied it.

TOM
Maybe he didn’t do it.

STACY
Jesus Tom! Ten seconds ago you were convinced he did it now you’re saying he didn’t. Come on man!

TOM
I’m sorry! I don’t know what to think anymore!

They hear a noise coming from outside the apartment.

Tom and Stacy look at each other.

TOM (CONT’D)

What was that?

Suddenly the front door is kicked open. Stacy and Tom dive to the side and take cover. The man who killed Katie starts firing at them with a silenced pistol. Stacy pulls out her gun and fires back, also with a silencer.

Tom initially doesn’t fire his weapon. He takes his time, breathes heavily then fires two shots at the man hitting him in the quad twice. The man screams in pain, falls to the ground and drops his weapon.

Tom and Stacy get up and run towards the man. Stacy pins the man down on the ground.

STACY
Who sent you?

HenCHMAN
I’m not saying shit! Bitch!

Stacy looks at Tom. Tom then takes a cloth and shoves it into the mans mouth. Stacy shoots him in the leg, he screams but no one can hear anything. He squirms in pain for several seconds. Once he’s calmed down a bit Tom removes the cloth.

STACY
One more time. Who sent you? 

HENCHMAN
Alright, alright. His name is Mr. Yang.

STACY
Why does he want us dead?

HENCHMAN
I’m sorry I can’t say.

STACY
Do I need to shoot you again?

HeNCHMAN
If I say they’ll do worse to me.

TOM
So just say you got away.

HENCHMAN
What?
TOM
You tell us everything we need to know then you go back to your boss and say you got away.

HENCHMAN
You’ll let me go if I talk?

TOM
Stacy?
STACY
Yeah, we’ll let you go.

HeNCHMAN
How can I trust you?

TOM
Well you can’t but if you don’t talk she’ll definitely kill you so you might as well take the chance. (Smiles)

HENCHMAN
Fine, I’ll talk.

STACY
So much for loyalty.

HENCHMAN
I want to survive, screw loyalty. Loyalty gets you killed.

STACY
Guess so. OK so why are you here?

HENCHMAN
Some girl is working with Mr. Yang. She gave me this address and a couple others and he said I should go after whoever lived there.

STACY
What’s her name?

HENCHMAN
I don’t remember, maybe something with a J.

TOM
Jill?
HENCHMAN
Yeah, that’s it.

STACY
Why did she say she wanted us dead?

HENCHMAN
She didn’t say. Mr. Yang mentioned going after the other members of the team.

TOM
Did you go after anyone else?

HENCHMAN
Some girl who lived-

STACY
Did you shoot her in the head?

HENCHMAN
... Yes.

Stacy is visibly upset, but she regains her composure fairly quickly.

STACY
And we were second on your list?

HENCHMAN
Yeah. Look I’m sorry if I went after your friend, I was doing a job.

STACY
Don’t try to defend it just shut up.

TOM
So Josh didn’t kill her.

STACY
I guess not. Did you kill anyone before that?

HeNCHMAN
No she was the first.

STACY
Anything else we would want to know?

HENCHMAN
Yeah, the girl had a bag of cash that she brought to Mr. Yang.

STACY
What kind of bag?

HENCHMAN
Some kind of duffle bag.

STACY
Where are they?

HENCHMAN
Roberts and 55th. 

STACY
How many people are there.

HENCHMAN
Mr. Yang, the girl, and one other guy.

STACY
Does he have more men?

HENCHMAN
Yeah just not there at all times.

STACY
So if we go in a couple of hours we should be fine.

HENCHMAN
He may call for more men if I don’t get in touch with him.

STACY
You’ll be able to talk to him.

HENCHMAN
Still if he hears that I got away and didn’t finish the job, he’ll want more security so you gotta be careful.

STACY
Tom, anything else we need to know?

TOM
I think we’re good.

STACY
Alright, you can go.

Stacy lets the man go. He gets up slowly and limps away.

TOM
So Josh never lied?

STACY
I guess not. He admitted when he killed Harriet and denied killing Katie. That seems to line up with what that guy said.

TOM
Don’t feel too bad. You can’t kill someone and admit to it and be absolved from all sin, yknow?

STACY
That’s fair. Let’s go.

TOM
Where to?

STACY
To find Josh then go after Jill.

TOM
What for?

STACY
To kill her.

InT. josh’s apartment

Stacy and Tom go knock on Josh’s door as loud as they can.

TOM
Josh! Open up!

Josh opens the door. He looks like he’s been up.

JOSH
What are you guys doing here?

STACY
We need to talk.

Stacy and Tom explain what happened.

JOSH
So Jill is trying to kill us?

STACY
Seems like it.

JOSH
Any idea why?

TOM
Probably money. I can’t believe she’d turn on us like this. At least when you kill people we care about, you tell us.

Stacy and Josh stare silently at Tom.

TOM (CONT’D)

To soon?

Josh
I’m surprised she’d just turn on us like that. Haven’t you known her since like pre-school.

STACY
That’s exactly why I’m not so surprised she did this. I asked her to do it cause she’d do anything for money. Admittedly this is a bit far to go, but still.

JOSH
So now what?

STACY
We go after her and take the money back?

TOM
Didn’t that guy say there was a Mr. Yang guy? He probably called for back up.

JOSH
Bursting into a place completely out numbered, guns blazing? Sounds like my kinda party.

STACY
Just like old times.

All three of them look at each other and smile.

TOM
I’m still mad at you (points at Josh)

JOSH
I’ll help you get our money back then if you still can’t stand me you’ll never hear from me again.

STACY
I want in on that.

INT. mR. YANG'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The henchman limps into the office.

JiLL
What the fuck happened?

HENCHMAN
I took out the first girl last night no problem. Then I went after the girl and the black guy, that didn’t go as well.

JILL
Fuck! I warned you!

Mr. YANG

What happened exactly?

JILL
Does it matter?!?! They probably followed you here and are gonna attack us now.

MR. YANG

Shut up! Let me think. What are you doing here anyway?

JILL
Don’t yell at me, if you would’ve listened to me and been careful none of this would have happened. I’m here making sure your guys don’t screw this up. Did you kill anyone?

HeNChMAN
The girl last night.

JILL
So the least threatening one. Fucking great!

MR. YANG

So now what? Since you have all the answers, what’s the plan?

JILL
Get more men here immediately. And shoot the dumbass that led them here.

HeNCHMAN
Sir, please. I beg of you.

Mr. YANG

I’m not gonna shoot him. Senseless murder is never the answer.

Mr. Yang says something to him in Chinese. The man thanks Mr. Yang and leaves. Mr. Yang pulls out his phone and calls for backup.

ExT. outside mr. Yang’s office

Tom, Josh and Stacy are in a car outside of Mr. Yang’s office. The building is in a run down area with no occupied buildings nearby. It doesn’t look like anyone lives with several miles from this building.

StACY
We have a plan?

JOSH
You were always the tactical leader.

TOM
I know I was upset about the killing thing before and I still am, but that’s because they were innocent people. These guys are not. So yknow  I’m giving you a James Bond.

JOSH
Huh?
TOM
Yknow you never appreciate my cultural wit.

STACY
I’m lost too.

TOM
“A License to Kill” you guys are morons.

STACY

I’m sorry, I’ve never heard James Bond used as a verb before. (Scoffs) dumbass.

TOM
I’m a genius who, like many, is unappreciated in his time.

STACY
You guys ready to go?

TOM
Ready as I’ll ever be.

STACY
We gotta take out those two without making to much noise. Tom if you please.

TOM
Right after we leave the car, I am on it.

The three of them quietly exit the car. Tom picks up his pistol and brings it close to his face. He aims carefully at the two men standing guard. He moves his gun back and forth between the locations of the two men several times. The movement gets tighter and more efficient each time.

Finally he aims at one of the men, he takes a deep breath. He fires a shot and immediately does what he had been practicing and moves his gun over instantly and fires at the 2nd man. He hits them both in the head. They fall to the floor.

Stacy leads the charge holding her pistol in hand. Tom and Josh also run towards the entrance, guns in hand. The two men that Tom killed were carrying semi-automatic guns. Josh and Stacy each help themselves to a weapon. They wrap their new guns around their torso while still holding on their silenced pistols in hand.

They pause at the door. Stacy cracks the door open slightly and peers in, she sees a narrow hallway and three man are standing guard. She turns to Josh and Tom.

STACY
Three guys. Two on the right one on the left. Looks like the “big bad” office is at the end of the hallway.

JOSH
Can we get cover once we’re inside?

STACY
Each guy is standing in front of a doorway so maybe we can get in those rooms.

TOM
So what’s our plan.

STACY
We take out these three here and stay out here, maybe fire then take cover and see if they respond. I’m the best with a semi so I’ll take these guys out, Josh you open the door on my count. 

They nod. Tom stays to the right of the door archway. Josh gets in position to get behind the door when it opens. Stacy gets ready to open fire. She turns to Josh and mouths a count down from three.

Josh pulls open the door suddenly the three men inside are startled. They turn towards the door, but it’s too late Stacy fires immediately and kills all three of them.

The three of them move in guns up, several men, run towards them and are shot instantly. Each member of the team searches the rooms. All clear. They take cover to the right and left of the door at the end of the hall.

TOM
That doesn’t look like the boss’s room. That looks like a Rainbow Six Vegas level.

STACY
What does that mean?

TOM
Lots of places to get cover but lots of people to shoot at.

JOsH
Where do you think his room is?

Stacy tries to peer her head out and look into the next room. The second her hair passes into the line of sight of the door a shot is fired at her. She quickly moves out of the way.

Josh and Stacy fire warning shots into the next room.

TOM
What’s the plan?

JOSH
We gotta get into the next room.

STACY
You guys cover me, I’ll run and try to get some cover in there.

JOSH
(Pulls out the semi-automatic) On it.

Josh begins to fire into the room like a mad men. All the people in there remain in cover. Stacy runs into the right side of the room and hides behind the base of a large pillar.

The room is massive. There are two floors, the base floor has lavish bookcases, tables, couches all of which look more expensive than anything should be. There is a semi-spiral staircase leading to a small open corridor on the second floor. There is bullet proof glass all across the side of the corridor. At the far east side of the corridor there is a door leading to Mr. Yang’s office. There are eight men firing at them currently.

Josh is on the left of the door frame in the previous room. He and Stacy can make eye contact. She looks at him he inaudibly says “Cover me”. She picks up her semi-automatic and opens fire at the henchman. She hits two of them, the rest stay in cover as to avoid the incoming fire.

Josh runs into the room, this time to the left hand side. He also takes cover behind a pillar. There is a henchman walking down the stairs firing back and forth between Josh and Stacy. Because of his height he has a fairly good angle at them but they don’t have a good angle to fire back.

STACY
TOM!!!
Tom looks into the room and sees the man on the stairs. He realizes that everyone is focused on Josh and Stacy that they have no idea he’s still in the previous room. He steps into the opening of the door, stands tall, aims his gun at the man and fires. He hits him in the shoulder the man stops firing.

Tom runs into the next room and takes cover near Stacy.

TOM
Happy?
STACY
Thanks.
TOM
How many are left?

STACY
I think 6 and a half.

TOM
Half?
STACY
You didn’t kill that guy.

TOM
Gotchya.
Tom is able to move over more to the right to the next piece of cover. He’s a marksman so any open window to fire he can hit. He has the angle on two guys. He fires at them and kills them.

Two guys get up to fire at Tom forgetting that Josh is at the other end. He gets up and hits those two while Stacy fires at the other two allowing Josh to work without disruption.

JOSH
Three left!

TOM
Two and a half!

JOSH
He can shoot a gun? He’s a full guy.

Stacy gets up to fire at on the remaining healthy guys, but as she does it she gets shot in the upper arm. In the left triceps.

TOM
Stace!
Josh doesn’t even flinch he takes out the two remaining guys who compromised their position to try and hit Stacy. He then runs over to the guy that Tom hit earlier and shoots him in the face.

Tom and Josh both run over to Stacy.

TOM (CONT’D)

Are you OK?

STACY
I’m fine. You guys got the rest?

Tom
You know Josh is heartless he killed them before he checked that you were OK.

JOSH
How does that make me heartless? What if she was dead, and I got killed cause I ran over to see that she was dead instead of just shooting the people who could kill me then going and checking?

TOM
That is a horrible hypothetical.

JOSH
If I would’ve followed your way of thinking all 3 of us would’ve been shot.

TOM
I only ran over here cause you took those two guys out. I’m not an idiot.

STACY
I just got shot and the most painful thing is me listening to you two argue!

TOM
Oh Jesus sorry!

They help Stacy up. Josh rips a dead henchman’s clothing and wraps Stacy’s arm tightly.

STACY
Thanks. Now let’s finish this.

TOM
You think she’s up there?

STACY
Probably.
They all proceed slowly up the stairs with their guns out. They reach the front of the corridor Jill opens the door that leads to the office and stick’s out a white cloth.

JilL
OK you guys win. Come in take your money and go.

STACY
Back up Jill!

JILL
Don’t worry we’re gonna be in the back of the room when you come in.

STACY
We?
JILL
Me and Mr. Yang.

TOM
You’ve lied to us and tried to kill us, why should we believe you?

JILL
You didn’t have machine guns pointed at me when I did those things.

TOM
Works for me.

STACY
OK, we’re coming in back up.

JilL
OK.
Jill walks to the back of the room. Stacy, Josh and Tom proceed slowly towards the door still with their guns raised. They open the door slowly and creep into the room. There are two people in there Mr. Yang and Jill. Mr. Yang is leaning against the wall with his arms behind his back. Jill is standing behind the desk.

MR. YANG

You guys are very rude.

STACY
You shouldn’t have hired this double crossing bitch and you never would’ve heard of us.

JilL
Is that a nice thing to call your best friend?

TOM
Spare the bullshit.

STACY
Why’d you do this, Jill?

JilL
Same reason you did.

STACY
Oh really, what’s that?

JILL
Money.
STACY
I didn’t do this for money I did it to help people.

JILL
Give me a break! You stole almost 10 million dollars, and you’re saying you did it to help people? Come on Stace admit it we’re all in this for ourselves.

STACY
We all agreed to donate half our shares. So yes that is doing it to help people.

JILL
Why not give it all?

STACY
Half of our earnings is a very nice amount.

JILL
Whatever you say.

STACY
We were gonna split the money between the six of us. Why would you betray us?

JILL
I wanted more money.

STACY
You’d turn your back on your friends for some extra cash.

JILL
HA! You make it sound like fifty dollars! We’re talking about three million.

STACY
That’s worth it to you?

JILL
Wow, I never pictured you as the type to get offended by something like this. I expect that shit from Tom not from you.

TOM
Hey!
JILL
Oh you know it’s true.

STACY
So why didn’t you just take the money alone why did you involve this guy?

JILL
I didn’t think you guys would appreciate me taking your money.

STACY
So you wanted us dead?

JILL
Basically. And I would’ve had things my way if this dumbass 

would’ve just listened to me.

MR. YANG

I’m sorry you didn’t tell me they were trained killers!

JILL
I told you they were in the military! What did you think that meant? That they liked to wear camo-shorts?

STACY
Shut up! Both of you. Jill toss me the money.

JILL
What?
STACY
Zip the bag up and toss it to me.

Tom keeps his gun locked on Mr. Yang, while Josh and Stacy have their guns on Jill. Jill slowly proceeds to close the bag. Suddenly Jill pulls out her gun and takes two shots and Stacy. Josh jumps in front of Stacy and is hit in the chest twice. Stacy fired her gun the moment Jill fired and she hit Jill in the right pectoral muscle.

A second after Jill drew her gun Mr. Yang went for his but it wasn’t in time, Tom fired three times hitting him in the head all three times.

Josh falls to the floor and bleeding profusely. He’s dying fast. Jill is not in nearly as bad shape but she would die without medical attention.

Tom and Stacy run over to Josh to try and save him.

STACY (CONT’D)

Josh! Stay with me!!

JOSH
(Whispers) Finally..... Peace.

Josh dies on the floor in Stacy’s arms. Jill is on the other side of the room coughing loudly. Stacy gets up and goes over to Jill. She shoots Jill in the leg once. Jill screams in pain. Stacy shoots her in the leg two more times. Then points her gun at Jill’s face.

STACY
Any last words?

JILL
(Chuckles) You think you’re so much better than me. You think you’re a saint and that I’m the one who’s evil. But the truth is I’m just honest and you’re not. I admit that this whole job was for money and not for some made up cause that’ll help me feel better about stealing it. I actually admit I’m not a good person, that’s why I’m better than you, because you think you’re so high and mighty with your “mission to help people”. But you’re not, you’re money hungry like the rest of us. You just used this charity thing as a way to sugar coat the fact that you wanted to make some cash and needed an excuse to steal it.

STACY
You admit you’re bad and that’s why you’re better than me? Wouldn’t that just mean you admit you’re bad to say you’re good in which case you’re not good and you really are bad. Which might actually prove you right that you’re actually bad and admitting it. Look, I don’t think we have time to go through it cause you’re bleeding quite a bit.

JILL
(Chuckles) You can try to make a joke about what I’m saying but look at what you actually did and think about it. You stole from a casino and gave it to suffering veterans because they’re mistreated. What did the casino’s do wrong? Why punish them? You’re mad at the system not the casinos.

STACY
The casinos can spare the money that the veterans actually need.

JILL
There you go again thinking you’re in the right with twisted logic just to help yourself feel better. Just admit it you’re not in this to help people, you’re just a bad person.

STACY
In this case the ends justify the means. And yes, sometimes I can be a bad person.

She shoots Jill in the face.

Tom walks over to Stacy and gives her a hug.

TOM
Why didn’t you just let her die?

STACY
I deserved getting to shoot her for everything she did to me.

Stacy takes the bag of money zips it shut, puts it over her shoulder and walks out.

EXT. josh’s funeral - DAY

The weather is pleasant. There is a small group of people at the funeral. Mostly people who knew Josh from the military. No family. Tom and Stacy are in the front of the crowd. A priest is at the podium. 

Priest
Does anyone wish to say a few words?

Stacy turns to Tom. Tom, with tears in his eyes, shakes his head. Stacy gets up and goes to the podium. She stands in front of the crowd in silence for several seconds. She finally musters of the courage to speak.

STACY
I knew Josh for almost my entire life. Ever since we were growing up I realized how special of a person he was. He was witty, smart and clever but quiet at the same time. He didn’t feel like he had to say the most things in a conversation, he just felt that he needed to say the right things. He wanted to help people who couldn’t help themselves. He signed up for the military because he knew that he could do it and that made him responsible, in his mind, to do it. He had a lot of opinions, and when he truly believed in something he would say it regardless of how popular it was or wasn’t, or how much backlash he would get. But I, and everyone that knew him, always respected what he had to say, whether we agreed with him or not. He was able to effect people in a way that most can only dream of. People wanted to hear what he thought about something, or what his take was on an argument amongst peers. He told it like it was but he never hurt anyone doing it. He was blunt with the people he knew needed to hear it. But soft with those who couldn’t take it. It was an honour serving with him and it was an honour to be his friend. I loved him like a brother and I will always miss him. Thank you.

Stacy walks back to her seat and tears run down her face. But she holds herself together.

EXT. the park

Tom and Stacy are walking together after Josh’s funeral.

TOM
Two funerals in one day, what a shitty day.

STACY
Tell me about it.

TOM
That was a beautiful speech by the way, I don’t know how you came up with that.

STACY
I just said how I felt.

TOM
I’m glad you said that, cause I know that Josh would’ve wanted people to think of him the way you said you did.

STACY
I meant every word.

TOM
I don’t know how you did it, Katie was much harder on you than it was on me and I was a fucking wreck before.

STACY
I just put on a brave face for the speech, it wasn’t easy.

TOM
Well I appreciate you speaking. I didn’t feel as bad about not doing it myself once I heard your speech.

STACY
It helped me feel a little better. I feel like a lot of people don’t wanna confront how they feel and they just try to ignore it and trust me I’m guilty of it too. But talking about it just makes you feel better.

TOM
Oh for sure but once I start talking about this kinda stuff I would ball my eyes out and as a guy I’m not allowed to do that. 

STACY
I wouldn’t judge you.

TOM
You’d be alone there.

STACY
(Chuckles) Probably, but I think people do it even without you crying.

TOM
Was that a race thing?

STACY
What?! No! I just meant you’re-

TOM
I know, I know, just trying to lighten the mood.

STACY
You always do.

TOM
Because jokes help people feel better.

STACY
Yeah, but not when they’re non-stop every minute of the day.

TOM
Not everyone will hit but the one that does makes everyone feel better.

STACY
The only reason they needed to feel better was because you beat ‘em up with all the first 100 jokes.

TOM
Is this therapeutic for you?

STACY
What?
TOM
Making fun of me.

STACY
That definitely helps but the way I think you feel better about tragedy is you gotta accept the bad thing happened, and being sad won’t change that and just move on with life.

TOM
So you don’t believe in feeling sad?!?

STACY
I’m talking about after the initial grieving period.

TOM
It’s easier to think that way than to actually do it.

STACY
Accepting the ways of life just makes the shitty parts easier.

TOM
But doesn’t it make the good parts less fun?

STACY
It just helps put things into perspective I guess.

TOM
I guess.

STACY
That’s why I never stayed close with a lot of friends from High school or College.

TOM
What’s that got to do with it?

STACY
It’s just another way of realizing how life works and that eventually people drift apart, you don’t stay friends with everyone forever. You move to different neighborhoods or cities or even countries. So why try to stay in touch when the separation is inevitable?

TOM
So you think it’s better to just never have friends? That’s awful and frankly kind of stupid.

STACY
I don’t specifically avoid friendships it’s just a matter of the extra effort not being there, it’s just me bracing myself for the inevitable.

TOM
So why bother living if you’re eventually gonna die?

STACY
I’m not saying that I don’t have friends or I don’t grieve after a death it’s just that I try to realize that people don’t stay friends forever and bad things happen. I’m not saying live in a room forever and never go outside cause shit happens it’s just my way of coping with it all.

TOM
That doesn’t sound normal.

STACY
Ha, no ones normal Tom. I took a psychology class in college once and all the shit I learned about. Everyone’s technically got some kind of social disorder. So who is normal? God knows I never met anyone.

TOM
This conversation is getting me even more depressed.

STACY
Friends dying will do that to ya. Where’s the car?

TOM
Over there.

Tom points to the car, it’s a decent distance away. They start to walk towards it.

TOM (CONT’D)

It’s more than them dying though. I kinda feel like it’s my fault.

STACY
Everyone feels to blame after a tragedy, like how kids feel after their parents get divorced.

TOM
Wow you’re all over the place with the parallels. But this feels different though. This whole job we did, it turned everything to shit. We were working people who had pretty decent lives, we came back from the army with negligible physical and mental damage. Then we decide to do all this and everyone close to us ended up dead. 

STACY
We didn’t force anyone to do this, it was a collective idea. It’s not your fault, we were all in this together.

TOM
Maybe, but still. This whole thing just makes me feel terrible.

They reach the car.

STACY
I think I can help you feel better about it.

Stacy starts the car and they drive off.

ExT. ciTY STREET

Stacy and Tom pull over on the side of the road in a run down area where a lot of homeless veterans live. It’s a small congregation of people of different ages and races, most of whom suffer from some sort of disease resulting in their homlessness.

Stacy reaches into the back seat and pulls out two stacks of cash from the duffle bag totalling two-hundred-thousand dollars. She gives one stack to Tom. They get out of the car. There are 10 homeless veterans there.

Tom walks over to one of them he’s an older man in his late sixties to early seventies. He clearly has something wrong with him. Tom salutes him.

TOm
Where did you serve, sir?

Man
V-V-V-Vietnam son, and yourself?

TOM
Afghanistan, sir.

Tom pulls takes Twenty-thousand dollars cash and hands it to the man.

TOM (CONT’D)

Thank you for your service! Take this and get the help you need.

MAN
(Shocked) Thank you so much!

The man hugs Tom emphatically. Tom walks over to someone else and salutes again.

TOM
Where did you serve, sir?

The mans response is inaudible. We see the same events transpire. Stacy does the same thing. They’re each handing out money to all of them as the camera slowly pulls back.
